# Pip Reaper — Android Studio Project (Generated)

This is a generated Android Studio project skeleton implementing a **free** "Pip Reaper" app with:
- Sign up / Sign in screens (local mock authentication)
- Main converter UI (select files, start conversion — mock conversion for demo)
- No license checks, fully free to use
- Kotlin + AndroidX, minimumSdkVersion 21, targetSdkVersion 33

IMPORTANT: This environment cannot build an APK. To build an APK/AAB you must open this project in Android Studio (Arctic Fox or newer) on your machine and run **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)**.

Steps to build:
1. Unzip the project directory.
2. Open Android Studio and choose "Open" → select the project folder.
3. Let Gradle sync. Install/update SDK if requested.
4. Build a debug APK via Run or Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s).

If you want, I can also generate additional features (real file conversion integration, cloud backend, restore/persist accounts) — tell me which ones and I'll add them to the project.
